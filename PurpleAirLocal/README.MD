<h1>PurpleAir Local Driver</h1>
PurpleAir Local Driver pulls Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, Dew Point, AQI*, RSSI as well as PM1.0*, PM2.5* and PM10* particle reading directly from the device, no internet connection or cloud needed.
It has been tested on a BME280 (Classic)and should work for other single and dual laser models. It won't report VOC's, If there is interest I can add it.<br>
<b>* Devices with dual lasers the results will be averaged</b>
